## Notes

- Check items off as completed: `[x]`
- Add comments or findings inline
- Link to relevant resources or documentation
- Items are numbered sequentially for easy reference
- This checklist validates REQUIREMENT QUALITY, not implementation correctness
- Focus on what's WRITTEN (or missing) in the spec, not whether code works
